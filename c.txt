Undertaken correctly, physical training is a useful means of psychological manipulation: goals set, achieved, and surpassed in the gym—whether they are specifically transferable or not—stimulate psychological development we can express in the mountains. Constantly overcoming difficult training challenges and examining ourselves along the way improves self-assurance. That confidence frees imagination. It opens doors to new, more difficult projects, and expands our problem-solving repertoire.

Because those pioneers knew that alpinism—indeed all mindful pursuits—is at its most simple level the sum of your daily choices and daily practices. Progress is entirely personal. The spirit of climbing does not lie in outcomes—lists, times, your conquests. You do keep those; you will always know which mountains you have climbed, which you have not. What you can climb is a manifestation of the current, temporary, state of your whole self. You can’t fake a sub-four-minute mile just as you can’t pretend to do an asana. Ascent too is an expression of many skills developed, refined, mastered.

Consider that in the sport of running, the explosive power of a 100-meter sprinter and the dogged endurance of the ultra-marathoner are both running; yet the two are vastly different events. The surprise to many is that training for both of these events starts with the same general strength and conditioning to enhance basic physical qualities. As the 100-meter runner and the ultra-marathoner progress through their training plan, and through their careers, each will benefit from more and more specific training. This means that each will spend more and more time running distances and paces closer and closer to what they hope to achieve during their race. They know that the higher their level of basic fitness at the time they commence their event-specific training, the higher their performance will peak in their ultimate event.

Training needs to vary periodically. The body cannot run all year at the highest level. That’s a big problem for many climbers; they feel pressure to always to be their best. Trying to peak all the time creates a plateau, and no more performance improvements will be possible until you break this cycle. With appropriate training you will reach peak periods that are much higher than this plateau. You only have to arrange that you peak at the right moment, and this requires a plan. I always train according to a plan.

It might seem counterintuitive that light exercise when you are already fatigued could speed your recovery, versus lying on the couch.

This is the intensity zone that you will spend the vast majority of your time in the mountains at. Improving this quality will pay bigger dividends in alpine climbing than time spent improving any other quality because it allows you to sustain higher sub-maximal climbing speeds for longer times. Your pace will be faster for a lower energetic cost.

it is an intensity that for the less fit, is too hard to be easy, not hard enough to elicit the positive effects of high-intensity training, yet carries with it a burden of fatigue unworthy of its benefits. Unfortunately, this is the zone many amateur and poorly trained endurance athletes naturally settle into for the bulk of their training. The reason they do is that this effort level “feels like training,” whereas Zone 1 will usually (especially for the less aerobically fit) feel too easy, making many wonder if they are wasting their time. Unless you have a very strong background in aerobic endurance training, use this zone sparingly. Your perceptions

Indeed, opposition to government invasion of privacy was a major factor in the establishment of the United States itself, as American colonists protested laws that let British officials ransack at will any home they wished. It was legitimate, the colonists agreed, for the state to obtain specific, targeted warrants to search individuals when there was evidence to establish probable cause of their wrongdoing. But general warrants—the practice of making the entire citizenry subject to indiscriminate searches—were inherently illegitimate.

No matter the specific techniques involved, historically mass surveillance has had several constant attributes. Initially, it is always the country’s dissidents and marginalized who bear the brunt of the surveillance, leading those who support the government or are merely apathetic to mistakenly believe they are immune. And history shows that the mere existence of a mass surveillance apparatus, regardless of how it is used, is in itself sufficient to stifle dissent. A citizenry that is aware of always being watched quickly becomes a compliant and fearful one.

It was the world in which his mind and personality developed, a place unto itself that offered freedom, exploration, and the potential for intellectual growth and understanding.

To Snowden, the unique qualities of the Internet were incomparably valuable, to be preserved at all costs. He had used the Internet as a teenager to explore ideas and speak with people in faraway places and from radically different backgrounds whom he’d never otherwise have encountered. “Basically, the Internet allowed me to experience freedom and explore my full capacity as a human being.” Clearly animated, even passionate, when talking about the value of the Internet, Snowden added, “For many kids, the Internet is a means of self-actualization. It allows them to explore who they are and who they want to be, but that works only if we’re able to be private and anonymous, to make mistakes without them following us. I worry that mine was the last generation to enjoy that freedom.”

Though getting the documents out to the public was Snowden’s main consideration in the choice of destination, it was not the only one. He also wanted to be in a place where the people had a commitment to political values that were important to him. As he explained, the people of Hong Kong, though ultimately subject to the repressive rule of the Chinese government, had fought to preserve some basic political freedoms and created a vibrant climate of dissent. Snowden pointed out that Hong Kong had democratically elected leaders and was also the site of large street protests, including an annual march against the Tiananmen Square crackdown.

Janine conveyed what she had been told by the Guardian lawyers: publishing classified information can be depicted (albeit dubiously) as a crime by the US government, a violation of the Espionage Act, even for newspapers. The danger was particularly acute for documents relating to signals intelligence. The government had refrained from prosecuting media outlets in the past, but only as long as the media observed the unwritten rules giving officials an advance look and the opportunity to argue that publication would damage national security. This consultative process with the government, the Guardian lawyers explained, is what enables newspapers to demonstrate they have no intent to harm national security by publishing top secret documents and thus lack the requisite criminal intent to be prosecuted.

Until the spring of 2014, when controversy over the Snowden stories became increasingly intense, the agency was headed by four-star general Keith B. Alexander, who had overseen it for the previous nine years, aggressively increasing the NSA’s size and influence during his tenure.

Sex for the pleasure of women? To many, that idea was as unthinkable in 1950 as putting a man on the moon or playing baseball on plastic grass. Worse, it was dangerous. What would happen to the institutions of marriage and family? What would happen to love? If women had the power to control their own bodies, if they had the ability to choose when and whether they got pregnant, what would they want next? Two thousand years of Christianity and three hundred years of American Puritanism would come undone in an explosion of uncontrollable desire. Marriage vows would lose their meaning. The rules and roles of gender would be revocable. Science would do what the law so far had not; it would give women the chance to become equal partners with men. This was the technology Sanger had been seeking all her life.

An idea, no matter how good, might easily die if it were not aggressively pitched—to other scientists, to backers with deep pockets, and, ultimately, to the public. It was the selling that had helped sink him at Harvard, but Pincus was undeterred.

The Comstock Law defined immorality so broadly that it could have included anything, so it was no surprise that it was deemed to ban not only the sale of contraception but also the transmission of information regarding contraception. The only real surprise is that the law would continue to influence policy and keep women from getting birth control for as long as it did.

out of the blue—‘Birth Control!’” There was no sexual connotation involved, no declaration of independence, no threat. These were not fighting words. These were words, like her Quaker collar, designed to make people more comfortable. No one could object to “birth,” of course. Without birth there could be no life. But for Sanger, the key word was “control.” If women truly got to control when and how often they gave birth, if they got to control their own bodies, they would hold a kind of power never before

Once they gained control of their reproductive systems, they would go the next step: They would declare their own identities. Womanhood would no longer mean the same thing as motherhood. Women would delay pregnancy to attend college, travel the world, start jobs, launch magazines, write books, record albums, make movies, or anything else they could imagine. Sanger knew what birth control might do—some of it, anyway. Neither she nor anyone else could have imagined how birth control would also contribute to the spread of divorce, infidelity, single parenthood, abortion, and pornography.

The fault was not entirely Sanger’s. In some ways she was a victim of her own success. She had helped bring sex into the mainstream. She had helped build Planned Parenthood into an organization that spanned the country and improved the lives of millions. But as her organization grew, its leaders understandably became less tolerant of risk. They worried about the fate of their organization if Pincus gave them a pill that turned out to have harmful side effects or, worse, killed people or caused women to have children born with deformities. They were frightened by the idea of doing something that had never been tried before: giving medicine to healthy women simply to improve their lifestyles. A scandal or lawsuit could sink the entire organization. Planned Parenthood was not ready to go out on a limb, and certainly not for Pincus.

The sexual impulse is to me neither a low, degrading thing nor something extremely sacrosanct and holy. I regard [it] rather as a fundamentally normal, clean, lifeful instinct. The pleasure derived from its satisfaction, the release of tense emotions isn’t sinful of course. But I could never gain any real pleasure from promiscuous satisfaction. I feel that I must love the girl with whom I share this impulse. I do not think that it is necessary for me to wait till marriage for its satisfaction. And I would not feel obliged to wait until I am married because I don’t see why a legal ceremony makes it any more beautiful. I think you can understand this. For why should such a natural, fine ardor be repressed and held degraded because a justice of peace has not mumbled a few words!

The men assembled a guerrilla army of scientists, some of them outcasts, many of them brilliant, all of them lured by the opportunity to work of their own accord, without the pressures of university committees and in the presence of Pincus, whose reputation as a renegade and creative thinker was growing among those smart enough to look past the paranoid associations made by the press. By 1951 the Foundation employed fifty-seven men and women, making it by some accounts the largest privately owned independent scientific research institution in the country. There was no precedent for such an endeavor—one that had no specific goal other than to afford scientists the freedom to explore and invent as they pleased.

In other mammals, the sex drive lives only in the “lower nervous centers,” he explained, but in humans it passes upward from the groin to the base of the forebrain, where the urge for sex becomes “inextricably blended” with something we call love. Without this instinct for love, he said, man would be no more than beast. He asked: “Why, if sex is so natural . . . should any married person want or be required to restrict either its exercise or its output? The gruesome answer is inescapable. . . . If fertility is uncontrolled, normal expression of the sex instinct, even with the monogamous family that evolved for this very purpose, results in the fusion of more spermatozoa and eggs than most parents can safely culture, or Earth care for.” The solution, he said, was not for men and women to stop having sex. That impulse was too strong to be denied. And even if married couples did try to suppress their urges, without sex love would grow cold. But there was a way to help married couples continue to enjoy sex without having more babies than they desired. The solution, he said, was to find “a contraceptive as effective as continence but without its inherent disadvantages.”

Here was a medicine women would take more often than aspirin or penicillin, a pill they would take every day, possibly for years, in sickness and in health. If it worked, if it won approval, if it didn’t make women sick, and if it became popular or at least socially acceptable, millions of women all over the world might each consume 240 tablets a year at a price of about fifty cents a pill. The numbers were mind-boggling. It would easily be the biggest product Searle had ever brought to market. Best of all, they had paid almost nothing for it up to this point, because Katharine McCormick had carried most of the costs of research and development.

Yet when it came to sex, the pill had the opposite of Sanger’s desired effect for some women; it actually lowered their libidos. Sanger thought the pill would make married couples happier, but divorce rates have shot up since its advent. She also hoped the pill might lift women out of poverty and stop the world’s rapid population growth. In fact, the pill has been far more popular and had greater impact among the affluent than the poor and has been far more widely used in developed countries than developing ones.

For most of us, the typical prescribed 10 percentage point range will translate into a maximum of twenty beats and more likely in the seventeen to eighteen beat range.

your body and mind’s adaptation to training. Many studies have pointed to the anticipatory nature of this deeply ingrained self-preservation instinct. A dramatic disruption in your body’s homeostasis triggers a poorly understood but well-documented CNS response to protect the organism against irreversible damage. By repeatedly upsetting this homeostasis with training stimuli, the CNS begins to raise its threshold of alarm, which then allows you to push new limits in your training with a less-dramatic CNS reaction. The brain is the most powerful tool in your training arsenal.

and mental strength. Rest is the foundation of training. It is essential to balance periods of training or climbing with periods of downtime. I have learned to integrate mental training in a manner that is somewhat unconscious. Determination, motivation, visualization, courage, stress management, and channeling emotions must be concretely managed. These facets must never be considered as secondary priorities. Today 60 percent of what I teach young alpinists is management of the mental aspects of performance. That is to say, it is imperative to rest the body and the mind.

Many people use the mountains as a test site for self-validation: This virus afflicts the majority of young people who come to alpinism to some degree. I won’t claim that this is a bad thing, but for me that state was, thanks to Russo, unfamiliar. He forced us to understand that in giving your soul, strength, time, and money to the mountains, you must not demand anything in return; that a relationship of equals with the mountains is impossible; that a person is only a grain of sand in the ocean of existence; that the most important thing in the mountains is the people, your friends, and your relationships; and that not a single mountain is worth a single frostbitten and amputated little toe. Further, he taught us to act equally kindly toward people of a fanatical inclination (those who dedicated themselves body and soul to the mountains) as toward those people for whom this love was not the most important thing in their lives (those who loved the process of mountain climbing but were not prepared to dedicate their entire being to it).

The principles of training dictate that we are best served building general strength and fitness first. This plan provides a gradual adaptation period: The training load is held constant for the first three weeks; after that an increase of 10 percent in volume is held constant for weeks 4 and 5. Then a 5 percent increase in volume is held constant for weeks 6 and 7. Week 8 is a reduced training load to give your body a chance to catch up before launching into the Base Period—the meat of the training.

You should use a long-term general template such as the quarterly training log in chapter 7 that indicates the sort of average volume you are shooting for from month to month. From there it seems to work best to lay out more detailed training guidelines two, sometimes three, weeks in advance. This way you can target both the volume and the specific workouts you want to hit, without planning so far out into the future that your plan becomes an unrealistic shot in the dark that doesn’t allow flexibility. This gives you enough lead time to schedule training and climbing partners around daily life.

The most recent research concludes that endurance training, defined as training that lasts two to five hours, causes the athlete’s protein intake requirement to increase. Current guidelines suggest a range of 1.2 to 1.4 grams of protein intake per kilogram of body weight per day for endurance athletes, 50 to 85 percent more than the recommendations for non-athletes. For ultra-endurance distance athletes, those training for and competing in events lasting over five hours, the recommendation is 1.2 to 2.0 grams per kilogram, the higher value being for those starting out with endurance training and those engaging in high volumes of training.

carbohydrate and you become dependent on fat as a fuel. Depending on the individual’s fitness, their diet, and their exercise intensity, after about sixty to ninety minutes of exercise you need to start replacing carbohydrates that are needed in the fat metabolism process in order to continue to provide fuel for aerobic metabolism. Without feeding you will eventually bonk.

In the world of competitive endurance sports, athletes aim to eat a large meal three hours before their start time, then thirty minutes before start time they have a light carbohydrate snack such as a rice cake or energy drink. It doesn’t pay to eat while running a marathon or doing anything at very high intensities—in some cases speed climbing—as your gastrointestinal system will be shut down.

If you choose this path, you must remember to maintain strict discipline to the one-gel-per-hour-minimum rule. We reinforce this rule by using a watch alarm and an accessible supply of gels and water in jacket pockets. When possible, eat as many as three gels per hour. More than three will likely cause you to vomit, especially at high exertion levels. Gels cannot be replaced with the popular chews. The chews taste like candy because they are candy. Their predominance of simple carbohydrates will invite blood sugar spikes followed by the inevitable lows.

It’s remarkably easy to measure how much water you lose on a given training day. Weigh yourself before and after you train. Assuming you did not consume a large amount of food while exercising, the difference in your weight before and after exercise will tell you the weight of the water you lost. Since water weighs eight pounds per gallon, if you lost two pounds during exercise that means you lost a quarter of a gallon, or a quart of water during your workout.

Some experts recommend six liters per day at extreme altitudes, but the practical considerations of getting so much snow melted and water swallowed while alpine climbing makes this an impossibility, as we will discuss in the next chapter

While at the chemical level of metabolism, the efficiency of the different energy pathways is relatively fixed, with proper training you can alter the type of reactions (lipolysis, the metabolism of fats, or glycolysis, the metabolism of sugars) that are occurring. Whichever metabolic process your training promotes, through that training you prioritize that energy pathway and greatly influence the performance outcomes.

Prior to the invention of the first stored-program computer,[1] all computing devices, from the abacus to the earliest electronic computing machines, had to be manipulated by an operator or group of operators who manually entered a particular sequence of commands each time they wanted to make a particular calculation. In contrast, modern computers store and reuse such command sequences, and as such they have a level of flexibility and usefulness that sets them apart from everything that has come before.

During the first three weeks, your body rapidly adapts. During the next three weeks, if the training load is held constant, it begins to yield diminishing results as your body structurally and functionally adapts to that training stimulus. During these second three weeks many of the adaptations begin to consolidate, creating a base upon which to build the next step upward on the fitness ladder.

To be clear: Low intensity does not mean slow in well-conditioned athletes. Those who have spent the time to maximally develop their aerobic capacity can maintain prolonged high speeds (in conventional sports, typically 80–85 percent of race pace) at their aerobic threshold. A high aerobic threshold will allow you to make a strenuous approach with a heavy pack at a nice, fast pace while easily carrying on a conversation with your partner. It will mean that you will get to the base of route without spending much of your precious energy reserves, arriving in a refreshed state, rather than already being spanked before you set foot on the actual climbing route. Long slow distance (sometimes called LSD) is a misused phrase that does not describe the kind of training we are proposing here. Long EASY distance (LED) fits this training philosophy much better.

Please discover that transparency is the very foundation of fearlessness, and realize transparency in all three dimensions. First, become transparent to yourself through personal inquiry. Your meditation and sense of deep interiority reveal your mind, and all that it holds. Then, make the world transparent to you. See into the nature of reality, into the hearts of others, into the heart of the world. And finally, become transparent to others. Learn to be open, vulnerable, and undefended in your relationships. Realizing these three transparencies requires all of us to plunge into the unknown and unknowable of our own heart and mind and to open our heart to the world.

When I sit across from the man on death row who raped and killed an eleven-year-old girl, his eyes stare into mine through the food port in his narrow cell door; any thought of “saving his soul” would destroy the truth of that moment. I watch ideas about what I want for him arise, and I let them go with a breath. When I touch the hand of an old woman as the breath rattles out of her body, wanting to make her dying easier would only be an obstacle to my being there with her. Can

Tibetan teacher Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche often talked about “spiritual materialism,” meaning our desire to “get” enlightenment and even our noble-seeming aspirations to help others. Aspiring to awaken, or to benefit others, can be useful—it often helps with our priorities, just as having the goal of a sane and conscious death can help us to appreciate and relish this present moment. But if practice becomes a means to a “greater” end, then it becomes an investment—and we start expecting a profit. How can we be at one with a particular moment if we’re expecting something? How can we die freely if we’re fettered with the expectation of a so-called “good death?”

But then in the early 1990s, for reasons that are still a mystery to cops and academics alike, crime started dropping. Some say it was the advent of computer databases and advanced policing methods. Others say it was because of changes in the drug trade. Still others say it was cultural or had to do with the behavioral tendencies of a new influx of immigrants. Curiously, for instance, the drop in violent crime is most pronounced in cities with high immigrant populations.

Lawyers in this courthouse have yet another saying: “If you go in, you stay in. If you get out, you stay out.” If you get arrested for a B misdemeanor in New York City—let’s say it’s prostitution—you might face a punishment of fifteen to ninety days. But if you don’t make bail, you’ll almost automatically spend at least that long in jail waiting for trial. The state knows this, so essentially, charging a person who can’t make bail with a B misdemeanor is the same as convicting that person. You file the charge, the judge sets high bail, you go back inside, and then you eventually plead to time served, because, well, why not? You’ve already done the time.

The government’s rationale here is beautiful in its simplicity. American criminals have constitutional rights not because they are natural-born Americans but precisely because they are criminals. Deportations, however, are not part of the criminal justice system. “Removal proceedings,” wrote the circuit judge in the Gutierrez-Berdin case, “are civil, not criminal, and the exclusionary rule does not generally apply to them.”

Live in America, conduct your trades in the weaker regulatory arena in London, pay your taxes in Antigua or the Isle of Man. Keep the rights but offshore the responsibilities. The flip side is that there is a growing subset of people, like undocumented immigrants, who live below the level of full citizenship.

Under RICO, the leaders of a criminal syndicate are responsible for the actions of the people they hire to do their dirty work. In criminal law, it covers a mobster who orders a hit but doesn’t pull the trigger himself.

In another sense, though, the crime occurred nowhere in particular. If a hedge fund magnate in Westchester or Long Island sends an email to a bank analyst in Tennessee (where Morgan Keegan keeps its headquarters) to discuss the manipulation of the stock of a Canadian insurance company that’s listed on the New York Stock Exchange but retains a major subsidiary in New Jersey, where did the offense take place? It depended, entirely, on how you looked at things. Here again we have a major difference between the prosecution of ordinary street crime and the regulation of global finance. If you jump a fare on East 125th Street in Harlem, there’s no question which police force and which city’s set of laws apply to you. No lawyer is going to stand up in court and make the pseudometaphysical argument that the bus was actually built in Conway, Arkansas, or that the injured parties were actually the Chinese buyers of a transportation bond issued by the city of New York. No, you jump a fare in Manhattan, and it’s Manhattan cops who will knock you on the head and throw you in jail. And no judge will excuse you from the New York City dock because your home address happens to be Paterson, New Jersey. But this sort of thing happens all the time in global financial crime. Crimes happen everywhere and nowhere, and unless a major federal regulator asserts jurisdiction, defense lawyers can keep their clients from ever going near a courtroom simply by challenging the venue. This is exactly what happened in the Fairfax case.

Accepting impermanence and our shared mortality requires loosening the story knot: letting go of our concepts, ideas, and expectations around how we think dying ought to be. It also calls us to “practice dying”—that is, to let go, surrender, and give away, in the best of worlds, to practice generosity. We can do this now; at any time, we can start practicing dying. And if we do, we might also start to perceive the interdependence of suffering and joy—that life and death are not separate but intertwined like roots deep in the earth.

Death, however, is not usually regarded in contemporary Western culture as a teacher with whom to spend time, but rather as a looming biological and even moral failure to be denied and avoided. We do not hold a collective view of death as redemptive or liberating, but see it as an enemy to be beaten or, at best, a bad situation to be endured. The possibility of realization at the moment of death is not part of the story our culture is telling us; so death has little or nothing to offer most of us, and under those circumstances, it is often justifiably feared. When we distance ourselves from death in this unnatural way, it would seem that the only solution to the problem of dying is to avoid it at all costs! And costly it often is—as many of our health-care dollars are spent in the last six months of our lives.

The law is, of course, supposed to be precise, and civil lawsuits are designed to be careful, evidence-based determinations of right and wrong, liability and no liability. But the business of credit card litigation by its very nature has to be half-assed, brutal, reckless, and stupid. The business model just doesn’t work otherwise. The giant consumer credit merchants like Chase who file lawsuits against cardholders by the tens of thousands couldn’t even begin to make real money, real margins, if they had to do anything like real legal work or meet anything like a real evidentiary standard.

remembered when, still a student, I had spent several months working as a nursing assistant on the long-term psycho-geriatric ward of one of the huge long-term psychiatric hospitals that used to surround London. Most of the patients were profoundly demented. Some had come from the outside world with degenerative brain diseases, some were schizophrenics who had already spent most of their lives in the hospital and were now sinking to the end of their lives. To go to work at seven in the morning to be faced by a room of twenty-six doubly incontinent old men in beds is an education of sorts, as it was to wash them and shave them and feed them, and pot them, and strap them into geriatric chairs. I met some nurses who were utterly unsuited to the work and others who were quite remarkably patient and kind, in particular a wonderful West Indian man called Vince Hurley, who was the charge nurse for the ward. It was miserable work, with little reward, and I learned much about the limitations of human kindness, and in particular my own.

I told her that what the family wanted would be entirely determined by what she said to them. If she said ‘we can operate and remove the damaged brain and he may just survive’ they were bound to say that we should operate. If, instead, she said ‘If we operate there is no realistic chance of his getting back to an independent life. He will be left profoundly disabled. Would he want to survive like that?’ the family would probably give an entirely different answer. What she was really asking them with the first question was ‘Do you love him enough to look after him when he is disabled?’ and by saying this she was not giving them any choice. In cases like this we often end up operating because it’s easier than being honest and it means that we can avoid a painful conversation. You might think the operation has been a success because the patient leaves the hospital alive but if you saw them years later – as I often do – you would realize that the result of the operation was a human disaster.

it. Surgeons must always tell the truth but rarely, if ever, deprive patients of all hope. It can be very difficult to find the balance between optimism and realism. There are degrees of malignancy with tumours and you never know what will happen to the individual patient in front of you – there are always a few long-term survivors – not miracles but statistical outliers. So I tell my patients that if they are lucky they might live for many years, and if unlucky it might be much less. I tell them that when the tumour recurs it might be possible to treat them again and, although to some extent it is clutching at straws, you can always hope that some new treatment will be found. Besides, most patients and their families will research their disease online and the paternalistic white lies of the past will no longer be believed. Nevertheless, sooner or later, most of the patients, like Helen, will reach the point of no return. It is often very difficult for both doctor and patient to admit that it has been reached. The juniors in the morning meeting listened in the dark in respectful silence as I tried to explain all this, but I do not know if they really understood.

As so often happens, it was the vision of money that converted the doubting politicians who initially opposed, or were at least cool to, the Greenbelt idea. “What finally won the day was the concept of how valuable this Greenbelt would make the adjacent lands,” said Stanley Burns. “Once the city council got the message that these would be taxable properties of considerable value, whereas at the present time the land was worth virtually nothing on the tax rolls, and when developers could see the opportunities of having condos, apartments and various things along the Boise River, then it started catching hold.”

“That (setback) was a very, very controversial thing,” said Ken Pursley. “Landowners were extremely skeptical of it. They didn’t see the value of a Greenbelt to the development of property. They saw it only as a negative, as a restriction on what they could do. It was a very long, hard fight to get that done. But that was the key to preserving the land until it could be acquired. And it was the key to getting donations of land. Some of the landowners then ended up donating the 50 feet because it was encumbered by a setback anyway.” The setback quickly became a way for the city to acquire property without having to buy it, said Pursley. “Once the setback ordinance was in, they were more than willing in most cases to give us the 50 feet. That way they didn’t have to manage or maintain it. It was going to be a setback anyway so they couldn’t use it. And (developers) ended up getting credit for it in terms of doing a good project.”

1932, what would become Boise State was founded in the capital city as a private community college. In 1939, the city donated its old airport land on the south bank of the Boise River to the school, but with great foresight it retained a 100-foot easement through the property along the river. That strip subsequently became the point of strenuous debate when the school grew from junior college status to Boise State College in 1965 and to a university in 1974.

After the expense of the purchase, the group members couldn’t afford to repair the dam, and if it failed they feared their liability could total $5 million. For a time, it looked like a losing bet. Government at every level declined to take responsibility for the dam. Fortunately, the group made up in creativity what it lacked in cash. The ingenious solution: It simply refused to pay taxes for a few years and forced the county to foreclose. Once it owned it, the county had to repair it. “Now it’s a tremendous part of the Boise River Greenbelt system,” said Chapman.

Well adapted to long duration exercise at moderate power output, we could produce almost all of the power we required using fat as fuel and still go at a pace that an untrained climber could not maintain without dipping heavily into his limited glycogen.

The difference between a high- and a low-aerobic capacity is the difference in going from 14,200 feet (4,328 meters) to the summit of Denali and back in a short day with a good weather window versus struggling to get from 14,200 feet to the 17,200-foot (5,243-meter) camp in the same time, only to be pinned down in a nasty storm for two days and have the summit snatched away.

Within limits, the more often and the longer you can subject these muscle fibers to a mostly aerobic stress, the more mitochondrial mass will be produced (Harms and Hickson, 1983). In one study researchers found a near-linear relationship (up to a point) between the duration of work and the aerobic adaptation of the muscles. Provided that a certain minimal intensity is maintained, a doubling of exercise time resulted in performance improvements of between 40 percent and 100 percent (Harms and Hickson, 1983).

Ideally you will have access to a big/steep hill of at least 1,000 vertical feet (305 meters). If you don’t have such a big hill to train on, you’ll have to do more laps. As with steepness, longer is better, but you have to use what’s available.

You’d like to end this training cycle being able to cover at least the amount of vertical of your biggest potential day on your goal climb carrying a pack that is at least as heavy as you need on the real deal. As a guideline you should try to start this progression by climbing about 50 percent of your goal day’s vertical with 0 to 50 percent of the weight you’ll carry on that climb.

For example, let’s say your goal is to ascend Denali’s Cassin Ridge and you expect to be on the route three days. The biggest day aerobically will be 4,000 vertical feet (1,219 meters) of steep snow climbing to the 20,320-foot (6,194-meter) summit, but no technical climbing. The most technical climbing would likely be seven to twelve pitches wearing a heavy pack at the start of the route. None of the climbing is harder than a short section of 5.8 rock or seventy-degree ice.

Boukreev wrote: “After years of self-analysis, I know that the ability to fall asleep after hard work is an indication that my body is properly adjusting to the altitude. Difficulty falling asleep indicates that I must reduce the stress on my body and slow my rate of ascent.” You will recall that this concurs with the earlier discussion of autonomic nervous system balance between sympathetic and parasympathetic systems. An overstimulation of the sympathetic can leave you feeling wired and restless in bed, even when you’re exhausted.

While beneficial for training the heart muscle, if sustained for too long and too often, this level of intensity has some undesirable effects down at the skeletal muscle level that can actually lower your aerobic fitness as well as lead to exhaustion and overtraining.

Learn HTML and understand how CSS frameworks like Bootstrap and Foundation can help you create more useful markup. Javascript is also a must-learn for client-side work and it wouldn’t hurt to know how it is now making its way to the server (node/io.js) as well. And perhaps most importantly, acquire some data manipulation skills: learn mysql, work with some JSON. After all, the data is the most important thing.

I tried to act casual while I was doing it, but man, I was putting in serious, serious hours. I had this one guy who would say stuff to me like, “it must be nice to be unemployed.” Like I just watched TV all day and waited for my brain to teach itself. I would turn down invitations all the time, ones that I wanted to accept. I would spend summer weekends at the cafe, doing freshman CS exercises. My friends would be at the beach, and I’d be writing a linked list in C. I had a lot of false starts. After I figured out that the ruby book was no good for me, I got K&R, the C language book. I still remember getting stuck on chapter four about pointers. And I panicked and thought maybe I wasn’t smart enough to be a programmer if I couldn’t understand pointers.

Employers who are able to pick the diamonds in the rough, those who are self starters and self enforcing, will do all that is in their power to get up-to-speed as quickly as possible, making them a safer return on investment.

You’re surrounded and inspired by incredibly intelligent people and yet it feels like you’re the dumbest person in the industry.

This is the ‘poor man’s’ method, and I am one such graduate. The results will vary should you attempt to emulate what I did, as there is no set magic formula or path. But, I will give you an illustration of what’s possible in the time frame of a year. A clearer illustration of this path is laid out in Chapter 10.

Russ, my coworker, purchased the set of tutorials from the website http://www.raywenderlich.com. The site is still a great resource for me even to this day, as there are always new tutorials and features. The tutorial set is called the iOS Apprentice, which is currently in its third edition. An excellent feature of the tutorial is that it’s project based and guides you through building four actual iOS applications, covering a broad range of development topics. The tutorial, which can be downloaded at http://www.raywenderlich.com/store/ios-apprentice is only $54 for the PDF.

Sidebar: Muscle memory is a real thing. When I was studying for the bar exam, my retention and understanding went through the roof not only because I was passing through the material for a second time as it was technically review (if not the first), but because I was handwriting the important points as I was learning. I experienced the same thing when playing music on the guitar, or doing other complicated tasks. The process of physically doing something improved my recall and eventually my understanding of the subject matter. Programming is no different.

It took me about three to four months to work through the iOS Apprentice book, and during the entire time, I never felt truly comfortable with the material. Also, I could not admit that I had a deep understanding of what I was doing. Often, I had to repurpose many of the tutorials when I was attempting to build something of my own, making it a slight deviation. If you find yourself doing the same thing, don’t worry.

Started in the earlier days when the iOS Software Development Kit was released to the public in 2009, the course is offered every year to reflect the latest changes in the iOS API. The course is free for anyone to download and watch, and the lectures are each one hour long. The course follows a semester lecture format and is an upper division computer science course on the Stanford campus.

At the presentation layer of web development, the languages used to show what you see on the browser are HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The first two are markup languages with little or no logic, and Javascript is a higher level scripting programming language that runs on the browser.

Often in job postings, the employer will post the stack that they’re using to run their application. Though the role may not require it, having familiarity with some or all of the stack will be advantageous. Generalists—those who are master of none, but good at a lot—find themselves in demand at start ups where staff are expected to be more versatile. Compared to front end development jobs, these pay substantially more. This is because there is often more complexity in developing code for the server, because you’re dealing with problems that are more fundamentally rooted in computer science. Because of this, it may seen more abstract compared to front end development. Another reason could simply be the result of a cultural bias: back end developers can be more like engineers than are front end developers at a particular company. Front end development has its own issues and complexity, and cannot be strictly discounted as easier.

The development tools for Android are more difficult to use than is iOS.  There are less resources catered toward a beginning developer.  Development is often onerous because of the disparate devices on the market. Sometimes, you’ll spend close to half of your development time figuring out why a screen doesn’t render correctly on 20% of the different devices. Basically, there are more jobs because Android programming isn’t for the faint- hearted (iOS isn’t really either, but Android is more difficult to get up and running comparatively speaking).

Throughout your learning process, you’ll also learn something called Git, which is version control. Version control is a way to ensure that each change you make to a project is tracked so that if you need to go back to a version of your code that was made prior to a major change, that can be done. Git is free, and can be downloaded here. Through some of the tutorials like One Month Rails, Git will be covered. For a more dedicated resource to learn Git and GitHub, I recommend going to Udacity for their free course.

Indeed it is. We’re more socially isolated than ever, and we pass that isolation down to our children. Our religion has changed—built around churches heavy on emotional rhetoric but light on the kind of social support necessary to enable poor kids to do well. Many of us have dropped out of the labor force or have chosen not to relocate for better opportunities. Our men suffer from a peculiar crisis of masculinity in which some of the very traits that our culture inculcates make it difficult to succeed in a changing world.

Appalachian Odyssey, notes about the influx of hill people to Detroit: “It was not simply that the Appalachian migrants, as rural strangers ‘out of place’ in the city, were upsetting to Midwestern, urban whites. Rather, these migrants disrupted a broad set of assumptions held by northern whites about how white people appeared, spoke, and behaved . . . the disturbing aspect of hillbillies was their racialness. Ostensibly, they were of the same racial order (whites) as those who dominated economic, political, and social power in local and national arenas. But hillbillies shared many regional characteristics with the southern blacks arriving in Detroit.”

Please discover that transparency is the very foundation of fearlessness, and realize transparency in all three dimensions. First, become transparent to yourself through personal inquiry. Your meditation and sense of deep interiority reveal your mind, and all that it holds. Then, make the world transparent to you. See into the nature of reality, into the hearts of others, into the heart of the world. And finally, become transparent to others. Learn to be open, vulnerable, and undefended in your relationships. Realizing these three transparencies requires all of us to plunge into the unknown and unknowable of our own heart and mind and to open our heart to the world.

In the data he found an answer to his question, and much more. He discovered that while just over 90 percent of children born in 1940 went on to earn more than their parents, only 50 percent of children born in the 1980s did so. Every year, the economic future of an American child was a bit less bright. And the big reason was not lower rates of economic growth but the increasingly unequal distribution of money. More and more of the gains were being captured by the very rich.

The likely date was 4 B.C.E.9 The second section begins with Jesus’ baptism in the Jordan at the hands of the ascetic doomsday preacher John the Baptist.10 Jesus soon set out on his own, however, with his personally selected followers, “the Twelve,” later called Apostles, “those sent forth.” His ministry, almost exclusively conducted in the Galilean countryside, consisted mainly in the eschatological warning, much like John’s own, to “repent, for the Kingdom (of God) is at hand” and in preaching an ethic of social justice and compassion. There were frequent clashes with the Pharisees over matters of the law. This phase lasted one or two years. Finally, and here the Gospels grow more detailed and specific, there is the narrative of Jesus’ last days, which unfolded not in Galilee but in Jerusalem, and reached their climax on Passover, probably in 29 or 30 C.E., when he was executed by crucifixion on the orders of the Roman prefect of Judea, Pontius Pilate, but at the instigation of a Jewish high-priestly cabal, as the Gospels have it. His body was removed from the cross before the sunset that would begin the Sabbath—Passover fell on a Friday that year—and hurriedly buried in a newly hewn rock tomb nearby.11 The Gospel authors were now faced with an enormous paradox. The man whom his disciples thought might be the Messiah of Israel had died an ignominious public death. His followers were in despair. And yet, within thirty-odd years, perhaps sooner, that despair had given way to a kind of exaltation: it was because the Messiah had died on the cross that all humankind was saved. Jesus was none other than the “suffering messiah” foretold by Isaiah, the “despised servant” who had “given himself up as sacrifice for sin.”12 Between the crucifixion and the later readjustment of messianic expectations occurred the extraordinary event of the resurrection.13 It was an event without witnesses, however. That Sunday morning, when the Sabbath was over and Jesus’ followers could return to the site, they found an empty tomb. Not long after, Jesus himself began to appear, undoubtedly alive, undoubtedly in the flesh, and yet undoubtedly different from the man they had known before.14 Though the somewhat later Jewish historian Josephus (d. 95 C.E.) takes explicit though only passing note of Jesus and his death,15 the rabbinic references from 200 onward are invariably oblique—it was neither a prudent nor a pleasant topic—and occur in the context of the Mishnaic treatise “Sanhedrin” dealing with judicial procedures.16 The texts agree that Jesus, Jeshua ben Pandera, as he is often referred to, was tried before a Jewish court, found guilty, and put to death, either by stoning or hanging (on a cross?), “because he had practiced sorcery and enticed Israel to apostasy.” There is no mention of Roman involvement in the matter. It was quite otherwise among the Muslims. The Quran’s thirty-five references to Isa ibn Miryam show an extraordinary regard for Jesus, “the Messiah,” as it frequently titles him, and it castigates both the Jews for claiming to have killed him—in the Muslim view Jesus was taken alive into heaven, where he will remain until his return on the Day of Judgment—and the Christians for worshiping this exalted prophet who was nevertheless, like Muhammad, merely a mortal.17 His followers later came to believe that Jesus’ death and resurrection had ushered

Death, however, is not usually regarded in contemporary Western culture as a teacher with whom to spend time, but rather as a looming biological and even moral failure to be denied and avoided. We do not hold a collective view of death as redemptive or liberating, but see it as an enemy to be beaten or, at best, a bad situation to be endured. The possibility of realization at the moment of death is not part of the story our culture is telling us; so death has little or nothing to offer most of us, and under those circumstances, it is often justifiably feared. When we distance ourselves from death in this unnatural way, it would seem that the only solution to the problem of dying is to avoid it at all costs! And costly it often is—as many of our health-care dollars are spent in the last six months of our lives.

Don’t forget that depression is a vicious cycle. Having no motivation and no energy is a symptom of depression, and taking no action is also something that makes you feel more depressed. This cycle keeps going around and around. When you start to break that cycle by doing things, your level of overall depression will start to decrease, which will have the side effect of increasing that reservoir of motivation that you have to spend.

It is tethered to few, if any, meaningful policy preferences. It does not know, and does not care, about how competing proposals should be crafted, scrutinized, or implemented.

All the same, it was strange: even as the slice of America that disdained Kennedy grew slimmer, it was growing more distinct, better organized, more articulate. This constituency was on the move. It had a hero. Barry Goldwater gave 225 speeches on the road in 1961. He was becoming, in the words of an astute young Fortune reporter, “the favorite son of a state of mind.” And by the end of the summer, events would see to it that this state of mind would spread impressively.
